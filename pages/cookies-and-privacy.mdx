# Privacy

greenwebdev.org is a read-only resource providing technical advice to help web developers reduce the carbon footprint of their application. This application does not store, or attempt to store, any personally identifiable information from users - this includes anonymous analytics that would otherwise help us to improve the site.

# Cookies

We do not set any cookies on your device, however there are two "cookie-like" items that may be set on your device when you visit this application;

- **Cache Storage** - Caches data the user has already downloaded/read.
- **Service Worker** - Allows the user to install the app locally if they want to (will only be installed if the user asks it to be).

Both of these exist purely to prevent the user having to re-download data they've already downloaded and to make the site load faster. We believe this usage falls under the [ICO's exemptions](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies-and-similar-technologies/#exemptions) in that they are being set purely for the purpose of carrying out communication over a network (or in this case, NOT needlessly carrying out that communication). We also believe these cookies to be strictly necessary / essential to ensure this site maintains a low carbon footprint.
