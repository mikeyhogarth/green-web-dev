We encourage all developers to write sustainable applications, to use data responsibly and to not be wasteful with digital assets - however the intention is _not_ to make developers feel guilty over every single byte of data they use. You should not treat these prompts as "the law" or as weapons to attack people with - they are simply small cues to help raise awareness and inspire positive change for your application.

The impact of many of the prompts presented here are invisible to the naked eye whilst being extremely valuable under the hood... however some of them **do** have a visual impact on things like image quality, brand identity and user experience. In some cases, the act of reducing the carbon footprint can actually have a _noticable_ and _negative_ impact on your users if taken too far.

Many of the bigger pain points are related to **design**, an aspect where many tradeoffs can be made and their "vitalness" to the application is subjective. Being sustainable does _not_ necessarily mean that your application will be unattractive (this site has a tiny amount of CSS, for example), but many common design best practices can be quite carbon heavy whilst adding only non-functional features that slow down page load speeds and are largely just "nice to haves" from a user perpective:

- Large, bold images
- Hero Banners
- Transitions and Animations

It is possible to take things too far in either direction. You could, for example, abandon CSS styles and sacrifice any custom look and feel for your site entirely - this will have a noticable _positive_ impact on your website's carbon footprint but is also likely to _negatively_ impact conversions, giving your users the impression that your site is unprofessional or that it has encountered an error. It won't, as they say, "pop" any more and this could seriously reduce customer engagement.

This is not about scrabbling about over every CPU cycle / bit of data or causing fights between development teams and design teams over sustainability - it is about striking a comfortable balance between your appliction's carbon footprint and the value it is offering to users.
