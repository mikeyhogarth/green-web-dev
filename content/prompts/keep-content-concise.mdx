Try to front-load your content, and keep it concise and to the point. The days of packing a page with words purely for SEO are over, and doing so now may actually [harm your SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide).

As well as being a good way to engage your users, there are a few sustainability angles to this:

- Padding content increases page load times and data sent over the wire.
- In being forced to read excessive text to find something, users are likely to spend longer than necessary on your site, which may reduce their desire to engage or return.
